This is an amplify gen 2 react native project in typescript, please use best practices such as always using functions instead of React.FC.

I will be saving data locally first and then syncing data manually to save api costs.

I like modular small components for better readability, reusability.

If you find yourself fixing an issue, take a step back, reassess and find a solution instead of just solving the solution right away
